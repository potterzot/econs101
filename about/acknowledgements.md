This course web page is based on the [Semester Biology](http://datacarpentry.org/semester-biology) course developed as part of The Carpentries primarily by [Ethan White](http://ethanwhite.org) and [Zachary Brym](http://zackbrym.weecology.org/).

#### Data Carpentry

[Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org/) is a web and workshop based organization that is designed to teach
basic computing concepts, skills, and tools for working with scientific data.
The resources provided on this site are being developed in association with Data
Carpentry.

#### Software Carpentry

[Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org) has been teaching scientists and engineers the concepts, skills,
and tools they need to use and build software more productively since 1977. All
of the content is freely available under a Creative Commons license (the same
one we use here), and the existence of this content not only saves me a massive
amount of time and effort, but also taught me a lot of what I know about
programming well.

#### Infrastructure

The site is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) with the [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) theme from [Poole](http://getpoole.com/)
and icons from [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) by Dave Gandy.
