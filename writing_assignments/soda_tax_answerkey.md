(a). An increase in the price shifts the budget constraint, so that each consumer can now purchase 10 SSBs if they purchase no water. The tax will result in less SSBs purchased.

(b). Utility will decrease because the best indifference curve that intersects the budget constraint will be closer to zero.

(c). Consumers may drive to other towns to purchase SSBs, thereby avoiding the tax and reducing tax revenue for Berkeley.
