(a).The article is implicitly assuming that consumers are inelastic in their demand for gasoline below $4.00 per gallon. Other answers include that gas is a necessity so individuals are inelastic in their demand for gasoline but the behavior is correctly described as inelastic. 

(b). As individuals likely need to utilize some gas to get to a McDonalds or a Lowes gasoline is a compliment to those goods.

(c). The price level currently falls on the inelastic portion of the demand curve. A given change in prices results in a small change in the quantity demanded. 

(d). Above a price of $4.00 per gallon individuals are on the elastic portion of their demand curve. At this point we expect a 1% change in prices will result in a greater than 1% decrease in quantity demanded.
