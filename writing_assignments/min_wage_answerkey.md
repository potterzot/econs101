#### Section 1. 
(a). Point C in the figure is competitive equilibrium. 
(b). Under a competitive equilibrium a minimum wage reduces employment.
(c). Point B is the equilibrium employment and wage under monopsony.
(d). The minimum wage increases both wages and employment under monopsony.

#### Section 2.

Monopsony has __redistributive__ and __waste__ effects, as well as __misemployment__, __employers cutting benefits instead of wages__, __increased consumer prices__, and __reinforcing monopoly power__.

#### Section 3.

Card and Krueger's finding that the minimum wage did not reduce employment suggests that the market is a monopsony market and not a competitive market, since firms were able to absorb the higher wage without reducing employment.
