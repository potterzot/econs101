## Pregame

* Sapling is not working for multiple classes and students - I will postpone homework for a week, but that means two homeworks will be due next Friday at 5pm.


## Feedback

<h3 style="color: green;">Good: </h3>
* I enjoyed the videos as visual interpreting the new information being taught.
* I liked thinking about how people typically make irrational choices rather than making perfect rational choices all the time.

<h3 style="color: red;">Needs improvement: </h3>
* Please go slower and take more time explaining concepts used in class, beginning with vocab, and then how it applies to real world scenarios.
* Finishing each lesson in class, so when you do the knowledge check we got it.


## Questions? Critiques?


## Production

"The production of too many useful things results in too many useless people." -- Karl Marx


## Production Questions

* How can we describe the way things are made generally?
* What different kinds of resources are needed to produce goods?
* How do different resources behave differently?


## Production functions

* **Production function** - *a function that describes the quantity of output generated from a given amount of inputs.*

E.g.: What does it take to produce coffee?
  
  * coffee beans
  * baristas, managers
  * equipment (grinder, espresso machine, refrigerator)
  * a building
  * power
  * etc...
  
All of these are inputs!

## Types of inputs

* **Fixed input** - *An input that can't be changed in the short run.*
* **Variable input** - *An input that can vary easily at any time.*

> - **But**: All inputs are variable in the __long run__.

## Long run and short run

From Krugman and Wells:

* The __long run__ is the period in which all inputs can be varied.
* The __short run__ is the period in which at least one input is fixed.

E.g: Buildings are __fixed__ in the __short term__, but you can expand or buy more buildings in the __long term__, so they are variable in the __long term__.


## Total Product

* **Total Product Curve** - *Shows quantity produced as the quantity of a variable input changes.*

Imagine you have only one cash register and one espresso machine...

```{r tp, echo=FALSE, out.width = "75%"}
d <- data.frame(Labor = 1:10)
d$Lattes <- 1 + 2*log((d$Labor)^(0.6))

ggplot(data = d) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = Labor, y = Lattes), color = "red", size = 1, alpha = .8) +
  xkcdaxis(c(0,10), c(0,5)) + 
  xlab("Labor") + ylab("Lattes per minute") +
  ggtitle("Production of lattes per worker") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 16, family = "Humor Sans"))
  
```


## Whaaaaa?

## An example with numbers { .flexbox .smaller }

```{r latte_table, echo=FALSE}
d["Marginal Production"] <- 
d2 <- d %>%
  mutate("Marginal Production" = Lattes - lag(Lattes, default = 0))
pander(d2)
```

## An exmaple plotted
```{r tp2, echo=FALSE}

ggplot(data = d) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = Labor, y = Lattes), color = "red", size = 1, alpha = .8) +
  
  geom_segment(aes(x = 1, xend = 1.8, y = d[d$Labor == 1,]$Lattes, yend = d[d$Labor == 1,]$Lattes), 
               color = "deepskyblue4", linetype = 2, alpha = .9, arrow = arrow(ends = "last", length = unit(10, units = "pt"))) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 2, xend = 2, y = d[d$Labor == 1,]$Lattes, yend = (d[d$Labor == 2,]$Lattes - .1)), 
               color = "deepskyblue4", linetype = 2, alpha = .9, arrow = arrow(ends = "last", length = unit(10, units = "pt"))) +
  
  geom_segment(aes(x = 6.2, xend = 6.8, y = d[d$Labor == 6,]$Lattes, yend = d[d$Labor == 6,]$Lattes), 
               color = "deepskyblue4", linetype = 2, alpha = .9, arrow = arrow(ends = "last", length = unit(10, units = "pt"))) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 7, xend = 7, y = d[d$Labor == 6,]$Lattes, yend = (d[d$Labor == 7,]$Lattes - .1)), 
               color = "deepskyblue4", linetype = 2, alpha = .9, arrow = arrow(ends = "last", length = unit(10, units = "pt"))) +
  
  annotate(geom = "text", x = 9, y = d[d$Labor == 10,]$Lattes, label = "TP", color = "deepskyblue4") + 
  
  xkcdaxis(c(0,10), c(0,5)) + 
  xlab("Labor") + ylab("Lattes per minute") +
  ggtitle("Production of lattes per worker") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 16, family = "Humor Sans"))
```


## Marginality again?!?

```{r gosh, echo=FALSE, out.width = "75%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("images/gosh.gif"))
```


## Marginal production

* **Marginal product** - *the additional output produced from one additional unit of input.*

$$\mbox{MP} = \frac{\Delta Q}{ \Delta X}$$

In particular:

* **Marginal product of labor** - *the additional output produced from one additional worker.*
* **Marginal product of capital** - *the additional output produced from one additional unit of capital.*

$$\mbox{MPL} = \frac{\Delta Q}{ \Delta L}, \; \; \mbox{MPK} = \frac{\Delta Q}{ \Delta K}$$

## Diminishing returns

* **Diminishing returns** - *Each additional increase in an input leads to a correspondingly smaller increase in output (i.e. the curve is shaped down).*


## Increasing fixed inputs

*What impact would increasing fixed costs have on production?*

## Increasing fixed inputs 
```{r tp3, echo=FALSE}
d3 <- d %>% 
  select(Lattes, Labor) %>%
  mutate(Lattes2 = 1 + 4*log((d$Labor)^(0.6))) %>%
  gather(key = "Fixed Costs", value = Lattes, -Labor)
d3[, "Fixed Costs"] <- c(rep("1 Espresso Machine", 10), rep("2 Espresso Machines", 10))

ggplot(data = d3) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = Labor, y = Lattes, group = `Fixed Costs`, color = `Fixed Costs`), size = 1, alpha = .8) +
  xkcdaxis(c(0,10), c(0,5)) + 
  xlab("Labor") + ylab("Lattes per minute") +
  ggtitle("Production of lattes per worker") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 16, family = "Humor Sans"))
```
