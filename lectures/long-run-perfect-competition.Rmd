## Perfect competition in the Long Run

- __Long Run__ - After firms have entered the market to drive profits down.
- __Short Run__ - Hold the number of firms fixed.

__Review of Acronyms:__

- __ATC__ - Average Total Cost $\frac{TC}{Q}$
- __AVC__ - Average Variable Cost $\frac{VC}{Q}$
- __MC__ - Marginal Cost (cost of one additional unit)
- __MR__ - Marginal Revenue (revenue from one additional unit)
