## Is price discrimination wrong?

## Is price discrimination wrong?

Say I am the lead economist at GoPro. Is it wrong if I:

- barter with each customer to agree on a price?
- give a discount if someone buys 10 at once?
- charge a different price to people who live in different cities?
- charge a higher price to people who are wearing fancier clothes?

__None of these is illegal.__


## Firms who have some market power don't have to be price-takers

- __[Price Discrimination](https://core-econ.org/the-economy/book/text/50-02-glossary.html?query=price+discrimination)__: A selling strategy in which different prices are set for different buyers or groups of buyers, or prices vary depending on the number of units purchased.

Reading: [How firms can influence prices](https://core-econ.org/the-economy/book/text/11.html#112-how-market-organization-can-influence-prices).

Tons of articles and opinions on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=price%20discrimination).


## Price discrimination has three types

1. __first degree__: each customer is charged their willingness-to-pay.
2. __second degree__: different prices are charged for different quantities purchased (e.g. Costco).
3. __third degree__: the market is divided into multiple sub-markets and each is charged a different price


## First degree price discrimination

- Charge each consumer their willingness-to-pay
- Producers capture all of the surplus


## Haggling: The original first degree price discrimination { .small }

## Second degree price discrimination

- Different prices for different sizes

E.g. A 16oz. bag of Santitas is \$0.18 per oz., an 8oz. bag is \$0.154 per oz.

```{r, out.width='70%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here("images/santitas.jpg"))
```


## Second degree price discrimination welfare effects

What are the welfare implications for people who have low incomes?

> - they pay more for food because they can't afford bulk purchases.


## Third degree price discrimination

- Divide the market into multiple segments, charge each segment a different price.


## Data science: categorizing people { .smaller }

One of the primary jobs for economists at companies like Amazon (or any online retailer) is to use people's data to categorize them into bins so you can charge a different price.


## Evidence for categorization

## Categorization gone bad

Categorization happens not just for market transactions. The excellent book [Weapons of Math Destruction](https://weaponsofmathdestructionbook.com/) discusses algorithms that categorize people and determine:

- prison sentence based on likelihood of recidivism
- ads for predatory loans displayed on google to people with low incomes
- hiring practices that replicate bias in past hiring decisions

_So when is categorization wrong?_
