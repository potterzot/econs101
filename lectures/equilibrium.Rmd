## Pregame { .smaller }

* First quiz moved to __Monday, October 1st__. 
* Class on Friday September 28th is cancelled (HOWEVER: extra credit for attending an alumni career networking event at 12pm in Paccar 202).
* Writing assignment feedback should come Thursday, then you have one week to revise and resubmit if you are not happy with your grade.

## Feedback

<h3 style="color: green;">Good: </h3>
* I like that you explain things in depth and you never have to rush your lectures.

<h3 style="color: red;">Needs improvement: </h3>
* There is little incentive for me to continue practicing problems when the homework only gives 2 attempts.
* The Sapling homework this week was bullshit and the questions could not have been more broad.

## Extra Credit Opportunity

* No class Friday, September 28th.

## Back to supply and demand

* Demand shifts left and right in response to changes in income, population, tastes, etc...
* Demand moves along the demand curve in response to price changes.

* Supply shifts in response to productivity changes or other factors that affect cost.
* Supply moves along the supply curve in response to price changes.

* __economic rents__ - _The value captured by suppliers or consumers when a market is not in equilibrium._

* Describe how the actions of bakeries could adjust the industry to a new equilibrium.
