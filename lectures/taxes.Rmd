  - roads

- To encourage or discourage behavior.


## Not always an effective behavior deterrent...

- Etc...

    "In this world, nothing can be said to be certain except death and taxes." - Benjamin Franklin


## Sales taxes

* __Excise tax__ - A tax on the sale of a good or service. It is usually composed of a local and state component.

[Washington DOR Sales Tax Schedule](https://dor.wa.gov/get-form-or-publication/forms-subject/local-sales-use-tax-rates-citycounty)

(A similar form exists for property taxes.)

## Taxes can be... { .smaller }

* __Progressive tax__ - A tax that __increases__ the percentage paid as income increases.
* __Regressive tax__ - A tax that __decreases__ the percentage paid as income increases.
* __Proportional tax__ - A tax that is the __same__ percentage of income regardless of income level.

Income tax in particular can be progressive ([Source](https://taxfoundation.org/2018-tax-brackets/)):

## Why U.S. income taxes are so difficult to file

## Subsidies / Tax Breaks

- A subsidy is a negative tax in which the government gives money.

Examples: Farm subsidies, corporate subsidies


## Subsidies / Tax Breaks: Competition over companies

Cities often compete to incentivize a company to move there by giving significant tax breaks. Often the cost of these tax breaks is higher than the benefit of the company.

## Subsidies / Tax Breaks: Support for low-income families

- The earned income tax credit (EITC) is a negative income tax for families with low incomes (\$6000 - \$15000 for no children, \$10000-\$40000 for one child).
- An interesting proposal much discussed globally is the __Universal Basic Income__ (UBI), in which all residents receive a subsidy, regardless of their income.
