## Pregame { .smaller }

* Interested in R (data science, analytics, research)? Come to the [R Working Group](https://cereo.wsu.edu/r-working-group/)!
* Interested in Python (data science, tech, programming)? Come to the [Python Working Group](https://cereo.wsu.edu/python-working-group/)!
* Interested in Economics? Join the [WSU Undergraduate Economics Club](http://ses.wsu.edu/undergraduate-programs/econclub/)!
* Sapling issues: instructions sent via Blackboard should fix it (fingers crossed).
* First extra credit is posted. All extra credit assignments can be done when you like but must be completed by December 7th at 5pm.
* Practice problems have also been posted. These are not graded but are there for you to practice for exams and to help with understanding concepts.
* EXTRA EXTRA CREDIT: Attend the Soonish lecture on Wednesday, Sept 5, at 5 pm in CUE 203. Verify your attendance [here](https://commonreading.wsu.edu/event-attendance/) to get credit (5 points).

## Types of costs

* __Fixed cost__ - *The cost of fixed inputs (i.e. inputs that can't change in the short run).*

In the coffee example, this would be your building, and potentially other items like the espresso machine and the refrigerator.

* __Variable cost__ - *The cost of variable inputs (i.e. inputs that change in the short run).*

for example: coffee, electricity, etc...


## Producing palm oil (1) { .flexbox .center }

```{r, out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("images/pc1.jpg"))
```


## Producing palm oil (2) { .flexbox .center }

```{r, out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("images/pc2.jpg"))
```


## Producing palm oil (3) { .flexbox .center }

```{r, out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("images/pc3.jpg"))
```


## Producing palm oil (4) { .flexbox .center }

```{r, out.width="75%"}

## Example of Marginal Productivity of Labor in roofing { .smaller }

**Production per week**:

```{r mpdata, echo=FALSE}
d <- tibble(
  "Workers" = 1:7,
  "Marginal Roof" = c(NA, .3, .5, .4, .3, .2, .1),
  "Number of Roofs" = c(.2, .5, 1, 1.4, 1.7, 1.9, 2),
  "Marginal Labor Cost" = 800,
  "Labor Cost" = 800*1:7
)
```

`r pander(d)`

## Graphing marginal productivity and costs { .flexbox .center }

```{r mp, echo=FALSE}
d2 <- gather(d, key = variable, value = value, -Workers)
d2$variable <- factor(d2$variable, levels = c("Marginal Roof", "Number of Roofs", "Marginal Labor Cost", "Labor Cost"), labels =  c("Marginal Roof", "Number of Roofs", "Marginal Labor Cost", "Labor Cost"))
ggplot(data = d2) +
  geom_line(aes(x = Workers, y = value), color = "seagreen4", size = 1, alpha = 0.8) +
  #xkcdaxis(c(0,7), c(0,2)) + 
  ylab("") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 16, family = "Humor Sans")) +
  facet_wrap(~ variable, ncol = 2, scales = "free_y") + 
  theme_bw() +
  theme(strip.background = element_blank(), strip.text = element_text(size = 12))
  
```


## Total cost

* __Total cost__ - *The sum of fixed and variable costs.*

If the fixed costs of the roofing business are \$400 a week, then total costs are:

$$\begin{aligned} 
TC &= FC + VC \\
TC &= 400 + 800*L \\
\end{aligned}$$

## Roofing total cost  { .smaller }

```{r tcdata, echo=FALSE}
d$`Fixed Cost` = 400
d$`Material Cost` = d$`Number of Roofs` * 2000
d$`Variable Cost` = d$`Material Cost` + d$`Labor Cost`
d$`Total Cost` = d$`Fixed Cost` + d$`Variable Cost`

panderOptions('table.split.table', 300)
```

`r pander(d[, c("Number of Roofs", "Fixed Cost", "Material Cost", "Variable Cost", "Labor Cost", "Total Cost")])`

## Graphing total cost

```{r tc, echo=FALSE}
d3 <- gather(d[, c("Fixed Cost", "Material Cost", "Variable Cost", "Labor Cost", "Total Cost", "Number of Roofs")], key = variable, value = value, -`Number of Roofs`)

ggplot(data = d3) +
  geom_line(aes(x = `Number of Roofs`, y = value, group = variable, color = variable), size = 1, alpha = 0.8) +
  xkcdaxis(c(0,2), c(0,10000)) + 
  theme(text = element_text(size = 16, family = "Humor Sans"))
  
```
