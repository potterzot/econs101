## Pregame { .smaller }

- The deluxe hugs video from the Market Structure lecture had a comment to a woman in it that I felt was pretty inappropriate, so I've replaced with a different video, but kept the link with an explanation.
- Practice Quiz 2 is up.
- Blackboard organization.
- Writing Assignment update.


## Feedback { .smaller }

<h3 style="color: green;">Good: </h3>
- Using memes 
- Real world examples
- I like that you go over homework in every class, it is actually really helpful! 
- I appreciate that you went back over all the previous equations, it was nice to have a refresher!

<h3 style="color: red;">Needs improvement: </h3>
- Tables with graphs?
- If possible, please post your lectures from when you do not teach class - if I don't understand something from a sub, this is helpful for me to look back on.
- Please finish the hw problems before the end of class because some people have to leave right at 2pm for another class.


## Imagine you're Google in the early days of search { .smaller }

The price you charge for ad space is determined by a competitive market, so __you can't charge any price you want__. You're a __price-taker__.

```{r out.width='50%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(here("images/pc_price_taker_meme.jpg"))
```


## Over time, you become more like a monopoly { .smaller }

You choose the price you want, and sell as many as the market will demand at that price. You're a __price setter__.

```{r out.width='60%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(here("images/monopoly_price_meme.png"))
```


## The primary difference between a price-taking firm and a monopolist firm { .smaller }

- Price-taking firm faces a demand curve that is market price.
- Monopolist firm faces a demand curve that is the actual demand curve.

```{r out.width='60%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Source: Krugman and Wells'}
knitr::include_graphics(here("images/kw_pc_monopolist_demand.png"))
```


## The primary difference between a price-taking firm and a monopolist firm

The implication is...

_If a firm has a monopoly, it can set the price at some point along the demand curve to maximize revenue._

## Monopolist maximizes profit across price and quantity

Since choosing the price affects the quantity the monopolist can sell, there are two effects. 

For example, if the monopolist increases prices:

- demand is lower so the firm sells less and revenue is reduced. This is the __Quantity Effect__.
- each unit sold is sold at a higher price, so revenue is increased. This is the __Price Effect__.


## Monopolist optimal output

The monopolist chooses quantity at which:

_Marginal Cost is equal to Marginal Revenue (MC = MR), but __not__ equal to price._

In a competitive market, MC = MR = Price, but in a monopoly, the price is higher.

## Monopolist profit

```{r out.width='80%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Source: Krugman and Wells'}
knitr::include_graphics(here("images/kw_monopolist_profit.png"))
```


## Raise the price

```{r out.width='60%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(here("images/monopoly_price_meme2.jpg"))
```
