## Pregame

* I'm going to email those of you who have lower than a 60% after the homework is submitted today to discuss options.
* First Quiz is 9/28, two weeks from today. I'll make a practice quiz available sometime next week.

## Feedback

<h3 style="color: green;">Good: </h3>
* Document camera was good.

<h3 style="color: red;">Needs improvement: </h3>
* Go over the writing assignment (we did this in the last class? #confused.gif).

## Aggregate Demand

* __Aggregate demand__ - _The sum of all consumer demand. Demand curves are summed horizontally._

```{r aggdemand, out.width="90%"}
d1 <- data.frame(
  Price = c(1, seq(10,200, 10))
) %>% mutate(Quantity = (200 - 10*Price^.5))/10

d1 <- d1 %>% mutate(
  Quantity2 = (d1$Quantity^1.1) * .6,
  Quantity3 = (d1$Quantity^.8) * .75,
  AggQuantity = Quantity + Quantity2 + Quantity3)

names(d1) <- c("Price", "Harry", "James", "Lilly", "Aggregate")
d1plt <- gather(d1, key = Variable, value = Quantity, -Price)

ggplot(data = d1plt) + 
  #xkcdline(data = d, aes(x = min(d$x), xend = max(d$x), y = min(d$y), yend = max(d$y)), color = "red", size = 2) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = Quantity, y = Price, group = Variable, color = Variable), size = 1, alpha = .8) +
  xkcdaxis(c(0,50), c(0,20)) + 
  ggtitle("Aggregate demand curve for magic wands") + 
  xlab("Quantity of Wands Demanded") + ylab("Price") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 16, family = "Humor Sans"),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 12)) 
#ggsave(here("images/agg_demand.png"))
```


## Substitutes and complements

* __Substitutes__ - Two goods are substitutes if a decrease in the price of one good __decreases__ demand for the other good.

_Examples include food away from home (FAFH) and food at home (FAH)._

* __Complements__ - Two goods are complements if a decrease in the price of one good __increases__ demand for the other good.

_Examples include gas prices and milk._

_Review Practice Problem 3._


## Normal and inferior goods

* __Normal goods__ - A normal good is one in which an increase in income __increases__ demand for that good or vice-versa.

_Examples include pretty much all goods._

* __Inferior goods__ - Goods are inferior if an increase in income __decreases__ demand for that good or vice-versa.

_Examples?_


## Universal Basic Income

* A Universal Basic Income (UBI) is a proposal to remove various social benefits and provide instead a basic income to everyone.

_What would a UBI do to spending for housing?_

* How __elastic__ is demand for housing? How much does demand change as price changes?
* How much would a UBI shift demand for housing, and in which direction?
* How would a UBI shift demand for food at home? For dining out?
