## Monopoly inefficiencies

- Higher price and lower quantity = deadweight loss
- But also, monopolists tend to stagnate, no longer innovating. This has a social cost.


## Natural Monopolies

- __Natural Monopoly__ - An industry in which there are significant economies of scale due to high fixed costs, i.e. the _marginal cost_ continues to decrease even for very high quantity produced.

For example, electrical production, water systems, roads, social network effects.

All benefit from initial investment and number of customers making it difficult for other firmst to enter the market, i.e. they create __barriers to entry__.

## Dealing with Monopolies { .smaller }

1. Anti-trust policy - legal frameworks to prevent or remove monopolies (here's a [list of all anti-trust suits the U.S. government has filed](https://www.justice.gov/atr/antitrust-case-filings-alpha)). Generally this is through one of two things:

  1. Break the company into multiple pieces (e.g. break AT&T into one company in each region of the U.S.).
  2. Require licensing of infrastructure or a process (e.g. cell providers must license their bandwidth to other providers).

2. Set price limits - but it is difficult to find the right price.
3. In a natural monopoly, take public ownership - but then incentives become political and these can be poorly run.
