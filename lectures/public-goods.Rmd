## Feedback

- The graph was easy to read and there was no chicken scratch.

- Are the readings/sapling exercises about them mandatory or just suggested?


## Classification of goods

We can divide goods into four groups based on two definitions:

- __Rivalrous Goods__ are goods whose consumption means they cannot be consumed by others. Examples: food, almost all material goods. Examples of nonrivalrous goods include: public health, quiet, works of art, national defense.


- __Excludable Goods__ are goods for which the supplier can limit access to only those who pay for it. Examples: Digital movies, almost all material goods. Examples of __Nonexcludable goods__ inlcude clean air, clean water, public pastures.


## Classifying types of goods

__Markets efficiently provide only the first category of goods.__

```


## Why Can't Markets Provide Other Types of Goods?

- Goods that are __nonexcludable__ suffer from a "free-rider" problem. Example: group projects.
- Goods that are __nonrivalrous__, the most efficient price is zero.


## Public Goods

Public goods are both __nonexcludable__ and __nonrivalrous__. In this way they are the opposite of private goods.

Examples:

- National Defense
- Scientific discoveries
- Herd immunity

The __marginal social benefit__ of a public good is the __sum__ of the individual marginal benefits.


## Common Pool Resources

## Common Pool Resources

A __common pool resource__ is __rivalrous__ but __nonexcludable__.

The issue is one of __overuse__. How do we get individuals to take into account the effect of their actions on the group?

- Tax or quota limits.
- Make the resource private.
- Tradable permits to use the resource.
- Community agreement to limit use.


## Community Solutions to Resource Management { .smaller }

"New Institutional Economics" pioneered by Nobel Laureate [Elinor Ostrom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom).

Top-down solutions like taxes and permits are subject to issues:

- corruption
- difficulty monitoring

Communities can manage themselves if group cohesion is high:

- members share similar viewpoints and goals and are relatively equal.
- other social interactions create bonds that encourage participation.


## Artificially Scarce Goods

__Artificially scare goods__ are excludable but nonrivalrous. These are things like digital media. 

- Excludable so sellers charge a positive price, 
- but nonrivalrous so more people could consume them and increase total social benefit.

Solution is similar to natural monopoly: regulate price (or just accept inefficiency).
