## How do we calculate global markets? { .smaller }

```{r two_markets, out.width="90%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(here("images/two_markets.png"))
```

1. Add up quantity demanded.
2. Add up quantity supplied.
3. Find the price at which Quantity Demanded = Quantity Supplied ($5, 500 lbs of coffee).
4. Since Guatamala produces 360lbs and only demands 280lbs, it exports 360-280 = 80lbs to Croatia.
