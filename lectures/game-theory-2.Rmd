## Pregame

* Change in office hours: Thursday 3:10-5pm so that students can discuss homework before it's due.
* Deadline to drop classes without a record: Tuesday, September 18th, 2018.

## Feedback

<h3 style="color: green;">Good: </h3>
* Going through homework problems is helpful.


<h3 style="color: red;">Needs improvement: </h3>
* Include more examples.
* Do some example problems throughout the week.
* Use the overhead camera for drawing by hand.

## The prisoner's dilemma

## The prisoner's dilemma in payoffs

```{r fig4.mcq.3a, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("images/core/figure-04-mcq-03.jpg"))
```


## What makes a prisoner's dilemma?

1. One strategy leads to a good payoff for both players.
2. But at that equilibrium, each player gets a higher payoff from switching.
3. If both switch, the payoff to both players is lower.

## Back to Ammeera and Dimitrios 

```{r fig4.mcq.3b, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("images/core/figure-04-mcq-03.jpg"))
```

## The prisoner's dilemma outcome

* If Ameera plays _Deny_ then it's in Dimitrios' best interest to play _Accuse_ (since 0 > -2).
* If Ameera plays _Accuse_ then it's in Dimitrios' best interest to play _Accuse_ (since -8 > -15).
* The same is true in reverse. If Dimitrios plays _Deny_, Ameera should play _Accuse_, and if Dimitrios plays _Accuse_, Ameera should play _Accuse_.
* The dominant strategy is for both players to accuse, receiving the largest penalty (-8,-8).

This is known as a __Nash Equilibrium__.


## Nash Equilibrium

* __Nash Equilibrium__ - _Is a set of strategies for each player in which no player can gain by switching to a different strategy, given the strategies of other players._

In the prisoner's dilemma, (Accuse, Accuse) is the Nash Equilibrium.

## Why the negative solution?

1. Players did not place any value on the payoffs of the other person, and so did not internalize (take account of) the costs that their actions inflicted on the other.
2. There is no way to make the player pay for harm caused to other players.
3. They were not able to make an agreement beforehand about what each would do.


## Solution 1: Other-regarding preferences

If players care about the outcomes of other players, then the payoffs change and the game may no longer be a prisoner's dilemma.

This can happen when social norms are strong, which can be affected by technology.


## Ghosting as a prisoner's dilemma { .vcenter .flexbox }

<div width = "60%">
|             | Ghost  | Say Goodbye |
| ----------- | ------ | ----------- |
| Ghost       | -2, -2 | 1, -3       | 
| Say Goodbye | -3, 1  | 0, 0        |

</div>


## Ghosting before cell phones { .vcenter .flexbox }

<div width = "60%">
|             | Ghost  | Say Goodbye |
| ----------- | ------ | ----------- |
| Ghost       | -2, -2 | 1, -3       | 
| Say Goodbye | -3, 1  | 0, 0        |
</div>


## Solution 2: Make players pay for harm caused to other players.

* In the cartel example, imagine companies can sign an agreement to punish non-cooperators.
* A group of friends who work out together may punish someone who doesn't show up.

What else?


## Solution 3: Previous communication?

__Can collusion offer a way out?__

> - Both parties agree to deny. What happens?

> - When it comes time to choose, each party still has an incentive to play Accuse instead.


## A better solution with previous communication

## { .vcenter .flexbox }

__Why did the first player play "split"?__

<div width = "60%">
|             | Steal     | Split |
| ----------- | ---------:| -----------:|
| Steal       | 0, 0      | 13000, 0    | 
| Split       | 0, 13000  | 6500, 6500  |
</div>

## A fourth solution: repeated games

* __Repeated Game__ - _A game that players play multiple times with the same payoffs and strategies_.
* __Tit-for-Tat__ - _A strategy in which a player starts out cooperating, but therafter copies the other player's previous action._

```{r fig4.mcq.3c, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("images/core/figure-04-mcq-03.jpg"))
```

## Tit-for-Tat

* Ameera knows if she defects that Dimitrios will defect next round, so it makes sense to cooperate.
* Dimitrios knows the same.

__Nash Equilibria__

1. If they start at Accuse, both players play Accuse forever.
2. If they start at Deny, both players play Deny forever.
3. Both players alternate playing (Deny, Accuse) forever.
