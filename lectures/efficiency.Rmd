## Total Surplus { .smaller }

* __Total Surplus__ - Total Surplus is the value to both _consumers_ and _producers_ of all the transactions in a market. It is the sum of producer surplus and consumer surplus.

$$TS = PS + CS.$$

## Larger Consumer Surplus

```{r psurplus}
q_max <- 1000
d <- data.frame(Price = seq(1, 100, length.out = 1000))
d$Demand <- q_max - 10*d$Price
d$Supply <- 20*d$Price

dplt <- gather(d, key = Variable, value = Quantity, -Price) %>%
  filter(Quantity > 0)

p_eqm <- 33
q_eqm <- 665

ggplot(data = dplt) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = 0, xend = q_eqm, y = p_eqm, yend = p_eqm), linetype = 2, color = "gray30", size = .2) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = q_eqm, xend = q_eqm, y = 0, yend = p_eqm), linetype = 2, color = "gray30", size = .3) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = Quantity, y = Price, group = Variable, color = Variable), size = 1) +
  annotate("text", x = q_eqm+200, y = p_eqm+1, label = paste0("(Q = ", q_eqm, ", P = ", p_eqm, ")")) +
  xkcdaxis(c(0,q_max), c(0,max(d$Price))) + 
  ggtitle("Larger Consumer Surplus") + 
  xlab("Quantity") + ylab("Price") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 16, family = "Humor Sans")) 

```


## Larger Producer Surplus

```{r csurplus}
q_max <- 1000
d <- data.frame(Price = seq(1, 100, length.out = 1000))
d$Demand <- q_max - 25*d$Price
d$Supply <- 20*d$Price

dplt <- gather(d, key = Variable, value = Quantity, -Price) %>%
  filter(Quantity > 0)

p_eqm <- 22
q_eqm <- 445

ggplot(data = dplt) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = 0, xend = q_eqm, y = p_eqm, yend = p_eqm), linetype = 2, color = "gray30", size = .2) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = q_eqm, xend = q_eqm, y = 0, yend = p_eqm), linetype = 2, color = "gray30", size = .3) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = Quantity, y = Price, group = Variable, color = Variable), size = 1) +
  annotate("text", x = q_eqm+220, y = p_eqm, label = paste0("(Q = ", q_eqm, ", P = ", p_eqm, ")")) +
  xkcdaxis(c(0,q_max), c(0,max(d$Price))) + 
  ggtitle("Larger Producer Surplus") + 
  xlab("Quantity") + ylab("Price") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 16, family = "Humor Sans")) 
```


## Market Interventions

__The government could:__

* __Reallocate between consumers__ - _redistribute goods from a consumer who bought it to a consumer who didn't._
* __Reallocate between sellers__ - _redistribute goods from a producers who sells to a producer who doesn't._
* __Change the quantity traded__ - _set a limit on the quantity sold._


## When Markets Work Well

* Lots of producers and consumers (not enough sellers leads to monopoly).
* Well defined property rights (who owns what means of production, what income, etc...).
* Enough information about the goods being sold (uncertainty makes purchasing difficult).


## When Markets Don't Work Well

* __Externalities__ - _If a market transaction leads to an externality (i.e. production damages others via pollution)._
* __Poorly defined property rights__ - _It's hard to sell or buy when there's uncertainty about ownership._
* __Monopoly or Oligopoly__ - _When there aren't enough sellers, monopoly producers can charge excess prices._
* __Monopsony__ - _When there are only a few buyers, they can withold transcations to force producers to sell for low prices._
* __Thinness__ - _If there are not many transactions, (i.e. the market is 'thin') then there are opportunities for arbitrage._
