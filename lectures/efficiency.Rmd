## Pregame

* I'll upload midterm grades Tuesday by 12pm.
* Wednesday writing assignment is due by 5pm!
* Extra credit opportunity: tonight (10/08) at 5:30pm in the Ensminger Pavilion. I'll be there to talk about Peace Corps!


## Writing Assignment 2 { .smaller }

The situation:

* No, not [that situation](http://entertainment.ie/celebrity-gossip/Mike-The-Situation-from-Jersey-Shore-sentenced-to-8-months-in-jail-for-tax-evasion/408819.htm).
* Three markets: Gasoline, fast food, and home improvement.
* [The article](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/rising-gas-prices-wont-hurt-retailers-for-now-14588845) suggests that consumers of gas have two different elasticities depending on the price point. 
  * what are those elasticities (i.e. which section is relatively inelastic and which is relatively elastic)?
  * what is the price point at which the demand curve becomes more (in)elastic?
  * which part of the demand curve is the price at now?
  * how does this affect fast food and home improvement? Are they compliments or substitutes?
  * how does this affect online retail?

## Nobel Prize in Economics 2018

* Paul Romer ([twitter](https://twitter.com/paulmromer), [website](https://paulromer.net/)) - How innovation affects growth.
* William Nordhaus ([website](https://sites.google.com/site/williamdnordhaus/papers_speeches)) - Economic effects of climate.

## Romer's charter cities

The problem:

* Worldwide there are lots of people who don't own land, so there is increasing immigration.

If we want equal treatment and we want democracy, the solution is difficult because _enforcing borders is expensive and not particularly effective_.

## Romer's charter cities

```


## Romer's charter cities

* If we want free mobility: people move in with different cultures and norms, we lose either equal treatment (if people are from a society that does not value gender equality) or democracy (if people are from a non-democratic society).

* If we want democracy: have to either restrict free mobility or restrict the ability of immigrants to vote, so we lose equal treatment.

* If we want equal treatment: have to either restrict free mobility or have an autocratic government, so we lose democracy.


## Romer's charter cities

__Solution:__ create new cities in the middle of unused space (i.e. the desert)

* Lay out the streets
* Allow people to stake claims anywhere but the street
* Worry about services like water and sewer later (but put them under the streets like we currently do)

## Total Surplus { .smaller }

* __Total Surplus__ - Total Surplus is the value to both _consumers_ and _producers_ of all the transactions in a market. It is the sum of producer surplus and consumer surplus.

$$TS = PS + CS.$$

## Larger Consumer Surplus

```{r psurplus}
q_max <- 1000
d <- data.frame(Price = seq(1, 100, length.out = 1000))
d$Demand <- q_max - 10*d$Price
d$Supply <- 20*d$Price

dplt <- gather(d, key = Variable, value = Quantity, -Price) %>%
  filter(Quantity > 0)

p_eqm <- 33
q_eqm <- 665

ggplot(data = dplt) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = 0, xend = q_eqm, y = p_eqm, yend = p_eqm), linetype = 2, color = "gray30", size = .2) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = q_eqm, xend = q_eqm, y = 0, yend = p_eqm), linetype = 2, color = "gray30", size = .3) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = Quantity, y = Price, group = Variable, color = Variable), size = 1) +
  annotate("text", x = q_eqm+200, y = p_eqm+1, label = paste0("(Q = ", q_eqm, ", P = ", p_eqm, ")")) +
  xkcdaxis(c(0,q_max), c(0,max(d$Price))) + 
  ggtitle("Larger Consumer Surplus") + 
  xlab("Quantity") + ylab("Price") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 16, family = "Humor Sans")) 

```


## Larger Producer Surplus

```{r csurplus}
q_max <- 1000
d <- data.frame(Price = seq(1, 100, length.out = 1000))
d$Demand <- q_max - 25*d$Price
d$Supply <- 20*d$Price

dplt <- gather(d, key = Variable, value = Quantity, -Price) %>%
  filter(Quantity > 0)

p_eqm <- 22
q_eqm <- 445

ggplot(data = dplt) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = 0, xend = q_eqm, y = p_eqm, yend = p_eqm), linetype = 2, color = "gray30", size = .2) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = q_eqm, xend = q_eqm, y = 0, yend = p_eqm), linetype = 2, color = "gray30", size = .3) +

  ggtitle("Larger Producer Surplus") +

```


## Market Interventions

__The government could:__

* __Reallocate between consumers__ - _redistribute goods from a consumer who bought it to a consumer who didn't._
* __Reallocate between sellers__ - _redistribute goods from a producers who sells to a producer who doesn't._
* __Change the quantity traded__ - _set a limit on the quantity sold._
* __Set a price__ - _enforce a lower or higher price._


## When Markets Work Well

* Lots of producers and consumers (not enough sellers leads to monopoly).
* Well defined property rights (who owns what means of production, what income, etc...).
* Enough information about the goods being sold (uncertainty makes purchasing difficult).


## When Markets Don't Work Well

* __Externalities__ - _If a market transaction leads to an externality (i.e. production damages others via pollution)._
* __Poorly defined property rights__ - _It's hard to sell or buy when there's uncertainty about ownership._
* __Monopoly or Oligopoly__ - _When there aren't enough sellers, monopoly producers can charge excess prices._
* __Monopsony__ - _When there are only a few buyers, they can withold transcations to force producers to sell for low prices._
* __Thinness__ - _If there are not many transactions, (i.e. the market is 'thin') then there are opportunities for arbitrage._
