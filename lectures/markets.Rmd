## Dimensions of market structure

```{r kw_ms, fig.align='center', out.width='90%', fig.cap="Market Structure (Krugman and Wells)."}

```


## Perfect competition

- __Price-Taking__ - A producer or consumer who does not have enough influence on the market to affect prices. A price-taking producer must set their price at or below the market price. A price-taking consumer must offer a price at least as high as the market price.

If both consumers and producers are price-taking, we say the market is __perfectly competitive__.

If just producers are price-takers, it is a __perfectly competitive industry__.


## Perfect competition requirements

- There must be enough producers and no producer can have a large enough __market share__ to affect prices. (E.g. corner stores and gas stations)

(__market share__ is the fraction of total revenue for the industry made up from a particular firm's revenues.)

- Consumers must regard the good from all firms as equivalent to each other. Goods are __perfect substitutes__. (E.g. oranges or other fruits, perhaps pens, bread.)

- Free entry and exit of firms (other firms can't keep firms out). (E.g. any business that requires licensing is not a competitive market.)


## Perfect Competition in the short run

```{r pc_sr, fig.align='center', out.width='90%'}

```


## Perfect Competition in the long run

```{r pc_lr, fig.align='center', out.width='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here("images/perfect_competition_lr.png"))
```

## Monopoly { .smaller }

- One firm produces the good.
- Since there is one firm, that firm can set the price.

```{r monopoly, fig.align='center', out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here("images/monopoly.png"))
```

## Monopoly requirements

A monopolist __must__ keep other firms from entering the market:

- Control natural resources (DeBeers diamonds).
- Technological superiority (Other firms can't produce).
- Increasing returns to scale (they can produce more cheaply).
- Government barriers: licenses, copyright, patents


## Oligopoly

- An __oligopoly__ is a few firms that have some price-setting power. Oligopolist firms can set prices to some extent, can collude to reduce production and/or elevate prices, and otherwise extort additional profits from consumers.

- The typical oligopoly game theory problem is the prisoner's dilemma. Do firms collude and keep output low and prices high? Or do they cheat?

## Measuring market concentration { .smaller }

The __Herfindal-Hirschman Index (HHI)__ measures market concentration, and is the sum of squared market shares. For example, if Amazon, Wal-Mart, Target, and five other smaller competitors have market shares of $25%$, $45%$, $15%$, and $5%$ each, the HHI is

$$HHI = 25^2 + 45^2 + 15^2 + 5 \times 5^2 = 3,000.$$

What's your intuition on:

- Airplanes
- Diamond mining
- Movie production
- Retail


## Market concentration for some markets

```


## Monopolistic Competition

All of the previous markets assume goods that are indistinquishable to consumers. 

But what if goods *are* distinguishable, or at least *seem* distinguisable?

Then firms engage in __monopolistic competition__.

- __Monopolistic__ because each firm produces a slightly different product.
- __Competition__ because consumers still substitute between similar goods, so firms compete on price and quality.
