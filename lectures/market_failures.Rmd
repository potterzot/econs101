- I would love if there was some way we could see the things you write on the paper on blackboard later on as a different form of notes for us to review.
- I would maybe like different slides to represent entire steps on their own, then when you move to the next slide you see the next logical thing that we are supposed to do for certain things.


## Externalities

- Market transactions can have effects on those not involved in the transaction. We call these __externalities__.

__Externality__: A side-effect generated by individuals' or firms' actions that imposes costs on others.

Externalities can be __positive__ or __negative__.


## Externality example: traffic

```{r out.width='90%}
knitr::include_graphics(here("images/externalities_traffic.jpg"))
```

## Other examples:

- Pollution: Since producers don't pay the cost of the pollution, they have no incentive to minimize pollution.
- Education: Education benefits the individual, but also increases the skillset of the labor force in general, making the country more competitive.
- Health Care: Behaviors that have negative health consequences are at least partially paid for by society or higher prices on other patients.
- Others?

[A bunch of popular media videos demonstrating externalities](https://econ.video/?s=externality).


## An externalitiy example in Idaho

The situation:

- Farmers use fertilizer to increase crop production.
- That fertilizer goes into streams.
- In streams, it causes algal blooms.
- These algal blooms kill fish and other aquatic life.

Idaho created a [web page for algal bloom alerts](http://www.deq.idaho.gov/water-quality/surface-water/recreation-health-advisories/).

Reference [this example](https://core-econ.org/the-economy/book/tex/t12.html#figure-12-4a) for similar graphs to the ones we'll draw out in class.
