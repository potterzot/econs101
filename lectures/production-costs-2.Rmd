## Average Variable Cost { .smaller }

* __Average Variable Cost (AVC)__ - *Total variable cost (TVC) divided by the total production. Variable costs consist of inputs that can be adjusted in the short term such as labor and supplies.*

E.g. if a college track team produces 4 star athletes per year and they have variable costs of \$2.5 million, the average variable cost is 

$$
\frac{TVC}{Q} = \frac{2.5}{4} = 625,000 \; \mbox{dollars.}
$$

## Average Total Cost { .smaller }

* __Average Total Cost__ - *Total cost divided by the total production. Total costs consist of the sum of total fixed costs and total variable costs.*

E.g. if the college track team has fixed costs of \$1 million and variable costs of \$2.5 million, the average total cost is 

$$
\frac{TC}{Q} = \frac{1 + 2.5}{4} = 875,000 \; \mbox{dollars.}
$$

## Marginal Cost { .smaller }

* __Marginal Cost__ - *The additional cost of one more unit of output. Marginal cost is equal to the slop of the Total Cost Curve.*

E.g. Suppose the college wants to produce 5 star athletes per year. They estimate that the total cost would be \$1.1 million in fixed costs and \$3 million in variable costs. Then the _marginal cost_ of the 5th star athlete is 

$$
\frac{\Delta TC}{\Delta Q} = \frac{(1.1 + 3) - (1 + 2.5)}{5 - 4} = 600,000 \; \mbox{dollars.}
$$

The new __Average Total Cost__ would be 

$$
\frac{TC}{Q} = \frac{1.1 + 3}{5} = 820,000 \; \mbox{dollars.}
$$

_What does this imply about whether the college should increase their investment in star athletes?_

## Why is the ATC curve U-shaped?

* __Spreading Effect__: On the one hand, each additional output lowers average fixed costs (AFC), so the ATC is declining,

* __Diminishing Marginal Returns__: on the other, each additional unit faces diminishing marginal returns from labor, so the ATC is increasing.

*At low levels of production, the cost savings due to the spreading effect are higher so ATC declines overall, but at higher levels of production diminishing marginal returns have a stronger effect so the ATC increases again.*


## Graphing Costs { .smaller }

M is the minimum average total cost. (Why?)

```{r tc-curve, out.width = "90%"}
tc <- tibble(
  Quantity = 1:1000,
  TFC = 10000
) %>%
  mutate(TVC = 0.2 * Quantity^2) %>%
  mutate(TC = TVC + TFC) %>%
  mutate(MC = TC - lag(TC)) %>%
  mutate(ATC = TC / Quantity,
         AVC = TVC / Quantity,
         AFC = TFC / Quantity)

tc2 <- tc %>%
  select("MC", "ATC", "AVC", "AFC", "Quantity") %>%
  gather(key = Variable, value = Cost, -Quantity)
ggplot(data = tc2) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = 225, xend = 225, y = 0, yend = 90), linetype = 2, color = "gray40", size = .2) +

## An example: the banana stand

Let's walk through this. Suppose we are 14 years old and our parents tell us 

    "there's always money in the banana stand."

## Can we use child labor for our banana stand?

## The banana stand { .smaller }

* Building the banana stand costs \$100.
* Bananas cost \$0.49 per pound.
* Cutting bananas has diminishing returns to scale (i.e. as we increase the amount of labor, the number of bananas each person can cut goes down -- the _marginal productivity_ of each additional worker is smaller than that of the worker before them.)
