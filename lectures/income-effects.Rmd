## Feedback

<h3 style="color: green;">Good: </h3>
* I like that you make sure that the class is still with you before moving on to the next topic. 

<h3 style="color: red;">Needs improvement: </h3>
* If you do a small like end of the week review on Friday for like 5 minutes of key points would be nice. 
* The sapling questions where you drag answers into boxes is confusing and doesn't give good feedback.
* Why have grades never been transferred over to blackboard?

## Substitution effects

* __Substitution Effect__ - _The effect (on quantity demanded) of a change in the price of a good as consumers substitute a good that has become relatively cheaper for the good that has become relatively more expensive._ 


## Income effects

* __Income Effect__ - _The effect (on quantity demanded) of a change in the price of a good due to the new price's effect on the consumer's purchasing power._

```


## Giffen Goods

* __Giffen Good__ - _A good that is an inferior good and that requires a substantial portion of the consumer's income. As a result, for a price increasee, demand will actually increase, since the consumer becomes relatively poorer and so spends even more money on the inferior good._
